## Min eye dropper 0.01

MCP is a straight forward and user-friendly Chrome extension color picker that allows you to get a color by selecting the HEX code of any pixel on a webpage and even outside the browser.

In other words, if your browser is not your only tool, you can freely choose the color of a pixel outside of your browser by activating the selector by clicking the "select color from the web page" button.

## The idea

Due to my needs, I had the notion to make this extension. I typically right-click a website's element to reveal the color, pick it up, and use it. I start looking for a tool to make it simple to achieve this. I discovered other programs that perform the same function, so a few weeks ago I decided "i will make my own color picker" a few weeks ago and the end product is shown here.

## Manifest file format and Manifest V3

For this extension im using [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) because it improves the security, privacy, and efficiency of our extensions; additionally, it enables them to employ more modern open web technologies like promises and service workers. If you dont know the Manifest file format you can [ visit this ](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/) doc by Google.

<hr/>

i will continue updating this extension and soon i will release some new features ( but the idea is keep it simple ) and add a `Help` and `Change logs` tab on the oficial [landing-page](https://touzand.github.io/eye-dropper-client). 

You can see the repo of the landing-page on [Min-eye-dropper-client](https://github.com/touzand/eye-dropper-client).
