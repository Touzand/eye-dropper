## MCP

MCP is a simple and easy to use chrome extension color picker with which you can select the color by choosing the HEX code of any pixel on your screen.

This means that if you are not limited to your browser, activating the selector by pressing the button that says "select color from the web page" you can even select the color of a pixel outside of your browser with total freedom
